# Parking-Lot
A Terminal Based, Parking Lot Tracker app

The .py file is ready to be opened and functions properly.
It opens a CLI where you have options to add your car number to park, unpark, locate your car and find nearest parking space.

note: This application runs on RAM and no database is maintained so it loses the data as soon as we close the app.
